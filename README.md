**Fovebo** helps teams turn "grown & fragile" systems into **calm and predictable** ones — with clear risk assessment, robust interfaces, and small, verifiable steps.  
This repository is the **developer’s view** of the Fovebo website.

## What’s in here

- **Homepage & copy** – the content you see on https://fovebo.com  
- **Services** – productized offers (quick checks, project bookings, retainers)  
- **FAQ & 404** – light, no-nonsense explanations and error handling  
- **Contact** – forms and scripts

> No buzzword fireworks. No glossy marketing. Just substance: **problem → approach → outcome**.

## What we do

- **Legacy modernization** without risky big-bang rewrites  
- **Perl maintenance & migration to Go**   
- **Database tuning & query optimization** where performance matters  
- **Microservices & APIs** that are boring (in the best way): reliable, observable, testable

**Approach:** Understand first, then change. We prioritize by impact and risk, deliver in **small, traceable releases**, and keep stakeholders in the loop at all times.

## Who this is for

- Your **legacy code** carries the business and **stability** beats hype  
- You need **migration without downtime**  
- You value **honest assessments** and **predictable delivery**
